# STATS 545B Functions Repository

Inside this repository, you will find the various folders and files which correspond to each 
assignment in the STAT545B class. Creating, cleaning, and sharing this repository provides 
hands-on learning and experience for me, so that I will be able to easily create clean, functioning 
repositories and share them whenever needed.

I will be updating this README file as the term progresses. As of Nov 2nd, this repository contains:

1. This README.md file.
2. The folder for Assignment B1:

      a. AssignmentB-1.Rmd, the R markdown file I created for the assignment
     
      b. AssignmentB-1.md, the knit, readable file
     
      c. AssignmentB-1 folder, a folder containing the outputs of the .Rmd file.
     
3. The R-Project file
4. The gitignore file


### Assignment B1
The purpose of Assignment B1 was to create a function I found useful. I created a function which can 
quickly create a boxplot and summary statistics of the body size of insects (or any measured numeric 
variable) from different experimental growth treatments. The function I made below is not meant to 
provide publishable figures and does not use any statistical analyses to determine significant 
relationships. It is meant to be used at the beginning of data analysis, to gain a general 
understanding of how the data looks.


Thank you for reading!
